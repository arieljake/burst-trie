### Bottom Line

The burst trie has significant advantages over other data structures storing large sets of string keys:

* requires no more memory than a binary tree
* as fast as a trie; and, while not as fast as a hash table, a burst trie maintains the strings in sorted or near-sorted order
* compared to a splay tree, the fastest variant of a burst trie can accumulate the vocabulary of a 10 Gb collection of web data in less than 40% of the time, while using no more memory
* compared to a ternary search tree, the burst trie is around 25% faster and uses only 50% of the memory and far outperforms the adaptivity of a splay tree to store frequently-accessed records

### Packages

Package | Description
------- | ----------- 
bst | Binary Search Tree
burst | Burst Strategies
trie | Burst Trie Implementation
writer | Writers for Burst Trie and various node types

### Basic Usage
```js
var BurstTrie = require("../index.js");
var myTrie = BurstTrie.createTrie();

myTrie.add('CAR');
myTrie.add('CART');
myTrie.add('CARE');
myTrie.add('CARTS');
myTrie.get('CARE');
```

### Print Trie
```js
var BurstTrieWriter = require("../trie/BurstTrieWriter.js");

BurstTrieWriter.write(myTrie)
```
